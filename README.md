# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently fails to render data fetched from an API.  The component may show an empty list despite the API call succeeding.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` fetches data from `https://api.example.com/data` (replace with a valid API endpoint for testing).  While the API call is successful and the data is available, the FlatList often remains empty, with no clear error message.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe the FlatList's behavior; it might sometimes render correctly, and sometimes show nothing.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully handling the data update and ensuring the `FlatList` re-renders when the data changes.  The `keyExtractor` is also improved for better performance and to avoid issues with data updates.
